12,Wisdom In The Word Bible Studies,Daniel: The Goat and The Two-Horned Ram - Hellenization Sets The World Stage For The Final Antichrist,4,48,"Join us as we continue parsing Daniel's vision of Gentile world rule. Here, he describes the battle between a goat and a two-horned ram for supremacy. This imagery describes world rule being transitioned from the Medo-Persian to the Greek empire. It's describes the beginning of the end-times thrust of the Hellenization of the world. The modern world we live, in its final phase before the end of the Age, is very heavily based on this transition.  What is Hellenism? Why is it considered the fulcrum point of world governance history?  Hellenization is the historical spread of ancient Greek culture, religion, and, to a lesser extent, language over peoples conquered by the Greeks, or brought into their sphere of influence, particularly during the Hellenistic period following the campaigns of Alexander the Great in the fourth century BC. The result of Hellenization was that elements of Greek origin combined in various forms and degrees with local elements, and these Greek influences spread from the Mediterranean basin as far east as modern-day Pakistan. In modern times, Hellenization has been associated with the adoption of modern Greek culture and the ethnic and cultural homogenization of Greece - and the world. Prophetically, the Hellenization of the world set the stage for the final act before the end. What is the final act? It is the crescendo of the Times Of The Gentiles through the follow-on Roman culture, and then it's rapid crash and destruction under the final Antichrist - who will be an export of this Hellenization/Roman system - when he comes on the scene.  The stage has been set. The curtain has risen. Make no mistake: YOU and I are alive and in this theater by God's will, for such a time as this. We ARE witnessing the end of the Age and how it comes about.",https://anchor.fm/biblestudyweekly/episodes/Special-Session-At-The-Very-Edge-Of-The-Age-Its-All-Converging-in-2021-e150mkb
13,Wisdom In The Word Bible Studies,Daniel: Unlocking The Fullness Of The Four Beasts Of Daniel's Vision (Part 1),4,45,"In this lesson, we move forward to Daniel chapter 7, which chronicles Daniel's vision of the four beasts that rise up out of the sea of humanity. The images of the beasts speaks to four Gentile kingdoms to rule, in turn, as the world runs through to the end of this Age. If you have been learning with us, you understand that the chapters of the book of Daniel are not all in chronological order. Because of this, chapter 7 brings us back in time to before the the handwriting on the wall that officially ended Belshazzar's time, and that of the Babylonian empire.  As we further allow Scripture to give the full truth and correct our worldview through it, learn with the class now, as we examine this major prophetic vision and its implications in history and for the end of the Age. The very time you and I live in now.  Chapter 7 brings us back to the first year of Belshazzar's role as the king of Babylon. At that time, Daniel was given a highly prophetic dream as visions passed through his mind, while he was lying on his bed. God gave him this key vision and had him record the fullness of the dream. ""In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea (of nations).",https://anchor.fm/biblestudyweekly/episodes/Special-Session-At-The-Very-Edge-Of-The-Age-Its-All-Converging-in-2021-e150mkb

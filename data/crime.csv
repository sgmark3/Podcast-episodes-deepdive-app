3,Supernatural Confessions,#6 - A Man Spent 10 Years Living in a Haunted Toa Payoh Flat,1,7,"Remember the old Iluma shopping centre at Bugis? You might have heard of rumours that the toilet there is haunted. Guest Edgar Saradetch had a first hand experience. ¬†¬†Also in this episode, Edgar shares how his family was too poor to move out, so they lived with the haunting in their old Toa Payoh flat for 10 years. ¬†This recording was done in his car while we were driving around. During that time, I was dragged into a world people don't talk about. These are the stuff you don't find detailed online because people with real stories don't share it with the world. We deal with it internally and try to rationalise the weird things until they fade from memory. This channel is a way for me and others like me to talk about our experiences to find closure. This is also for those looking for answers because talking about their encounters in public will just get them ridiculed.¬† .",https://anchor.fm/supernaturalconfessions/episodes/131---Combing-her-long-hair--Haunted-Study-Room--Lonely-Road-in-Sabah-Wednesday-Podcast-e1gfada

9,Breaking Math Podcast,41: Reality Is More Than Complex (Group Theory and Physics),3,57,"Children who are being taught mathematics often balk at the idea of negative numbers, thinking them to be fictional entities, and often only learn later that they are useful for expressing opposite extremes of things, such as considering a debt an amount of money with a negative sum. Similarly, students of mathematics often are puzzled by the idea of complex numbers, saying that it makes no sense to be able to take the square root of something negative, and only realizing later that these can have the meaning of two-dimensional direction and magnitude, or that they are essential to our modern understanding of electrical engineering. Our discussion today will be much more abstract than that. Much like in our discussion in episode five, ""Language of the Universe"", we will be discussing how math and physics draw inspiration from one another; we're going to talk about what different fields (such as the real, complex, and quaternion fields) seem to predict about our universe.",https://anchor.fm/breakingmathpodcast/episodes/70-1-Episode-70-1-of-Breaking-Math-Podcast-Self-Reference-e1fvjmk

In this podcast, we‚Äôre going to talk about the 4 reasons for high blood sugars in the morning.¬† This condition is called the dawn phenomenon. It can happen if you are a type 1 or type 2 diabetic, or if you have insulin resistance really bad.¬† Causes of elevated morning blood sugar: 1. Spike in Cortisol - Normally between 12 and 3 am, you have higher insulin sensitivity in the liver, so the blood sugar works a lot better. But, cortisol which mobilizes glucose for action and stress, peaks between 6 and 9 in the morning.¬† 2. Type 1 diabetes ‚Äì There‚Äôs a growth hormone spike that can mobilize the blood sugar. 3. Type 2 diabetes ‚Äì The liver is making glucose called gluconeogenesis. Also, glucagon and epinephrine are hormones that can spike blood sugar. If you are a type 2 diabetic for a long period of time, you are eventually going to lose the ability to produce insulin. 4. Consuming a lot of carbs the night before. ¬† What to do if you have high blood sugar in the morning: ‚Ä¢ Give it time ‚Äì Do the healthy ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting¬† ‚Ä¢ Exercise¬† ‚Ä¢ Avoid carbs ‚Äì especially the night before¬† ‚Ä¢ Take apple cider vinegar diluted with water the night before  Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio: Dr. Berg, 51 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in weight loss through nutritional & natural methods.

35,Throwback Country Music ,RESTLESS HEART-LARRY STEWART,11,34,"Restless Heart lead singer Larry Stewart can remember the exact moment and place his life began to change forever. ‚ÄúI was driving east on I-40 from West Nashville into town to an appointment,‚Äù he recalls. ‚ÄúBack then, I was listening to what we were doing in my Jeep Cherokee every day. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt sink in because I had it in the tape deck for days, then I realized ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs the radio. It‚Äôs WSIX.‚Äô I pulled over on the shoulder around White Bridge Road and sat there with my car idling. It was like yesterday.‚Äù ‚ÄòYesterday‚Äô has come full circle for Restless Heart. Then one of Nashville‚Äôs newest acts, the band is celebrating their 30th Anniversary in 2013, and Dave Innis enjoys the musical ride as much as ever. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs been an amazing legacy, and it‚Äôs been such an honor to have been part of an organization that is still together doing it after thirty years with the same five original guys, and it‚Äôs more fun than ever.‚Äù John Dittrich, Greg Jennings, Paul Gregg, Dave Innis, and Larry Stewart ‚Äì the men who make up Restless Heart have enjoyed one of the most successful careers in Country Music history, placing over 25 singles on the charts ‚Äì with six consecutive #1 hits, four of their albums have been certified Gold by the RIAA, and they have won a wide range of awards from many organizations ‚Äì including the Academy of Country Music‚Äôs Top Vocal Group trophy. Those stats aside, Innis feels that their career goes much deeper than that. ‚ÄúIn the past few years, we have really started to branch out in the community, particularly our work with the Nashville Rescue Mission. We have hosted an event called Restless Heart & Friends ‚Äì Music With A Mission that we do at the Schermerhorn Center with the Nashville Symphony. We invite a lot of our friends in the industry across all genres to join us, and all of the money we raise goes to the Nashville Rescue Mission. The other thing that stands out is the tours we have done in support of the men and women of the Armed Forces. We did some tours with the Air Force, going all over the world.‚Äù Those audiences have sung along with their record-shattering string of hits, such as ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Still Be Loving You,‚Äù ‚ÄúFast Movin‚Äô Train‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhen She Cries.‚Äù Stewart says it‚Äôs humbling to know Restless Heart has made an impact. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of the fact that we get to hear stories from young artists and musicians that we might have made an impression or inspiring them to come to town ‚Äì having number one records, and hearing the stories of what they meant to people. To know that you have been a part of something that made a difference, the power of music, the power of a song. To be a part of something that made a mark. However big or small of a mark Restless Heart made, it‚Äôs still a mark. To be able to appreciate and feel blessed that we got lucky enough to get together. I feel like it was something that was meant to be.‚Äù And, the story is far from over, as Stewart says Restless Heart still has a lot of history to make. ‚ÄúWe are still at the top of our game when it comes to singing and playing together. We‚Äôve got some projects we‚Äôre working on, and we want to put the Restless Heart brand out to music fans again ‚Äì to let them know we‚Äôre still here and making good music. We‚Äôre really looking forward, not trying to rest on our past laurels, we really want to do some new music.",https://anchor.fm/throwbackcountrymusic/episodes/BONUS-SHOW-Sittin-on-the-front-porch-talking-90s-Country-eoadks

So why is this not showing up in your social media? because it is not about being liked, or how many followers you have or have not, it is on a different energetic stream within subtle frequencies through infinite worm holes or vortexes beyond that currency, however all is always an energetic flow of infinite currencies within consciousness itself. What you ‚Äòthink‚Äô you know right now, has already transcended into something else, therefore to allow yourself to self realise that to ‚Äòknow nothing‚Äô is to be open to remembering, learning, experiencing, expressing differently moment to moment, because you have ceased to be so heavily invested in ensuring that you know something, feeling the need to prove it over and over again.

A place where there is no fear, therefore you are openly, consciously desiring to continue along the journey of expansion that is always evolving in form. This podcast touches base on one of our projects we are constructing and is still in the design prototype phase of the biomimicry on one level of the Desert Sturt Pea Flower but also in an alternate frequency reality a dwelling that is already manifested and being embodied by other worldly resonances in a different reality of sound frequency vibration, it is quantum physics in motion. You may be having amazingly insightful experiences yourself only to self realise that you are constantly moving on from each idea, belief system and constantly recognising the state of no nothing so you can yet again become something and cycle again to being open and no nothing as you continue along the path of expansion. Others may be at that point where you are creating, manifesting or in the movement of manifesting what you are desiring to be the creation of, excited by its potential in your life, we love hearing about your journey, so feel free to share as the more happy, openly expanding harmonic soundless to sound frequency vibrations are share the more we rise up and keep knowing nothing so we keep being open to growing, blossoming and continued expansion.

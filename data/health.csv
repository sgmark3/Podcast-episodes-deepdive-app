7,Dr Berg’s Healthy Keto and Intermittent Fasting Podcast,Does Looking at Sweets Spike Your Blood Sugar?,2,5,"It's free and very enlightening.  The answer is no – not in a fasting state. Looking at sweets and carbs will not cause an insulin spike.   The primary triggers of blood sugar are glucose and things that turn into glucose. But, anything you eat has the potential to trigger insulin just for the fact that you ate it. If it’s more carbohydrate, it will trigger your blood sugar more. If it’s less carbohydrate and more fat, it will trigger your blood sugar less.   Chronic high insulin can lead to insulin resistance.  Other triggers that can cause a blood sugar spike:  • Cortisol – Stress  • GIP  • Protein – especially if it’s low fat  Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio: Dr. Berg, 51 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in weight loss through nutritional & natural methods.

11,Dr Berg’s Healthy Keto and Intermittent Fasting Podcast,Craving Salt After Eating Your Salad or Vegetables?,3,3,"It's free and very enlightening.   Dr. Berg talks about why people crave salt after eating a salad or vegetables. Vegetables are high in potassium and low in sodium. This means you need 4700 mg of potassium to 1000 mg of sodium. Always add sea salt and this usually comes out to 1 tsp IF you are doing a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting. On the other hand, if you are doing higher amounts of carbs, you do not need so much sodium since glucose retains salt.  Consume sea salt with your diet, add it to your salad, eat olives, cheese and salted nuts to get your correct balance. If you are on a ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting, the need for sea salt goes up since running your body on fat requires less water. Higher carb diets require much more water and less salt, since with water comes the retention of sodium.   Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:  Dr. Berg, 51 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in weight loss through nutritional & natural methods.

17,21-Day Meditation Experience,Day 2 - Gratitude Is Within You,5,21,"Day 2 - Gratitude Is Within You “Gratitude is the experience of our true self.” ― Gina Lakes Gratitude is a two-way flow of appreciation between your thanks and the uplifting response that you feel in return. Today in our meditation, we begin that conversation and find that as this conversation expands, we create even more thankfulness. We discover how the flow of gratitude from the heart is received by Nature in the same spirit it is given, and it is returned back to us as grace. In today’s meditation, we learn to express gratitude from the silence of our awareness, which is the source of grace within. Daily Journal 1. Describe three qualities about yourself that you are most grateful for. 2. Write about a time when your gratitude or appreciation was received and reflected back to you, and you felt the situation was transformed by grace. List at least three people you would like to share your gratitude with more fully and more frequently. Then, write some specific ways you can do that. 4.
